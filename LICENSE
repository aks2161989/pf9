modifications. This includes the source files within the directories

	include, src/lib*, src/cmd

the scripts 9a, 9c, 9l in linux/bin 9.rc, doctype, man, lookman, lc and
psfonts in rc/bin, and some yacc/lex support files in lib.

The mkfile-hierarchy is based on files from Plan 9, i.e. the files

	sys/src/mkfile sys/src/mkfile.proto sys/src/cmd/mk*

are copies of the original Plan 9 files, some with slight modifications.
