A large part of pf9 is based on plan9port with only minor
modifications. This includes the source files within the directories

	sys/include, sys/src/cmd, and sys/src/lib*

the scripts 9a, 9c, 9l in linux/bin 9.rc, doctype, man, lookman, lc and
psfonts in rc/bin, and some yacc/lex support files in /sys/lib.

For plan9port the Lucent Public License, v1.02, applies, please see
LICENSE.plan9port for details.

If you run `mk' in sys/man and sys/lib, both directories will be
populated with a copy of files from a plan9port directory, if one is
available. The files beeing copied are necessary for the normal operation
of some programs in sys/src/cmd, like troff or man. They are used without
modification (except some paths) by the same programs as in plan9port.


---------------------------------------------------

The mkfile-hierarchy is based on files from Plan 9, i.e. the files

	sys/src/mkfile sys/src/mkfile.proto sys/src/cmd/mk*

are copies of the original Plan 9 files, some with slight modifications.


---------------------------------------------------

The `cygwin' directory contains a binary distribution of the cygwin DLL
v1.5.21-2, and its corresponding header files and libraries:

	cygwin/bin		- cygwin1.dll, cygcheck.exe, mount.exe, strace.exe
	cygwin/include		- header files (except u.h)
	cygwin/lib		- lib*.a

The GPL-based license can be found in cygwin/CYGWIN_LICENSE. According
