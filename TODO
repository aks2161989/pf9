-	isatty for mingw

-	libthread: works mostly, daemonizing works not

-	libdraw:	works basically, tested with tcolors, acme
		and sam. Events have not been ported, so only
		programs using the thread-based mouse
		interface will run.

-	cmd/test.c might need an update

-	cmd/ed.c could be made linkable again

-	cmd/9term/win.c could be ported, so that
	acme would also have a shell on Windows/MinGW
