A list of known bugs in the MinGW port:

* cmd/src/rc
	If at the beginning of a command line is a variable definition like in
		foo=1 cat
	and the command is interrupted using ^C, then commands started
	later also see the value of foo.

* lib9/mingw/fdtab
-	If a file descriptor is dup'ed, only the descriptor entry is duplicated, but
	not the file or resources. This seems to be ok for all stream-like files, but
	might cause problems for normal files, if one tried to read or write in the
	same file at different offsets via the original and a dup'ed fd. Most programs
	in p9p, though, don't seem to do this.

-	There is a bug in, or near, the dirstat code. It can be observed when running
	`du.exe -a' -- sometimes there will be files (or rather directories) missing.
